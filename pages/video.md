        This is a report I worked on in fall 2014 about Canada's aging electricity infrastructure.
<br>
<br>
<div class="well"><b>Intro:</b> A new campaign by the Canadian Electricity Association is trying to shine a light on Canada’s electricity infrastructure deficit.
They say it will cost $350-billion dollars over the next two decades just to keep the lights on. On top of that, they expect more demand on the grid from electric cars. All that adds up, and someone will have to pay for it all.

        This is a short feature-length documentary from May 2015 on a boxing gym that's trying to fix Ottawa's gang and drug problems by getting youth into the ring.</p> 
<br>
<br>
<div class="well">   
<b>Intro</b> One man in Southkeys is trying to fight Ottawa's drugs and gangs problem...one punch at a time. 
After hearing about an increase in gang activity in Ottawa, Eric Belanger decided to do something about it.
His boxing club -- Final Round -- is starting a pilot project that gives local youth a dollar-a-month membership. 
And it seems to be already working. Here's his story.

This is a short feature length story I shot in February 2015 about a Gatineau bike repair guy who builds his own unicycles and rides them through the park in the wintertime.
<br>
<br>
<div class="well">
<b>Intro:</b> Winter cycling through the woods can be tough. 
On windy days -- downright wicked. 
Jakob Flansberry has found a way to add to that challenge: lose one of your wheels.
Here's our story on the Gatineau bike repair guy who can do more with less.

	This is a short profile of two women from Thailand who now operate a foodtruck in Ottawa.
     <br>
	 <br>
 <div class="well">
<b>Intro:</b> In the middle of Ottawa's cold winter, two women are working hard to give their customers a warm taste of Thailand.
Jennie Chanthana and Nina Tawena started their business, the Pinn-to-Thai food truck, so they can share their culture's culinary experience -- and some smiles -- with Canadians.
Their truck is a hit with Ottawans looking for something hot to eat on a cold day.</div>
