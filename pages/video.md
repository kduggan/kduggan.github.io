        <h4 class="media-heading">Public Policy Reporting</h4>
        This is a report I worked on in fall 2014 about Canada's aging electricity infrastructure.
<br>
<br>
<div class="well"><b>Intro:</b> A new campaign by the Canadian Electricity Association is trying to shine a light on Canadaâ€™s electricity infrastructure deficit.
They say it will cost $350-billion dollars over the next two decades just to keep the lights on. On top of that, they expect more demand on the grid from electric cars. All that adds up, and someone will have to pay for it all.
Kyle Duggan reports.

<div class="well">
<b>Intro:</b> Winter cycling through the woods can be tough. 
On windy days -- downright wicked. 
Jakob Flansberry has found a way to add to that challenge: lose one of your wheels.
Here's our story on the Gatineau bike repair guy who can do more with less.

	This is a short profile of two women from Thailand who now operate a foodtruck in Ottawa.

 <div class="well">
<b>Intro:</b> In the middle of Ottawa's cold winter, two women are working hard to give their customers a warm taste of Thailand.
Jennie Chanthana and Nina Tawena started their business, the Pinn-to-Thai food truck, so they can share their culture's culinary experience -- and some smiles -- with Canadians.
Their truck is a hit with Ottawans looking for something hot to eat on a cold day.</div>
