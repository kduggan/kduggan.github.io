        This is a report I worked on in fall 2014 for a television reporting class at Carleton University about Canada's aging electricity infrastructure. Production and camera work by Paige Parsons and Brett Throop.
<br>
<br>
<div class="well"><b>Intro:</b> A new campaign by the Canadian Electricity Association is trying to shine a light on Canadaâ€™s electricity infrastructure deficit.
They say it will cost $350-billion dollars over the next two decades just to keep the lights on. On top of that, they expect more demand on the grid from electric cars. All that adds up, and someone will have to pay for it all.

His boxing club -- Final Round -- is starting a pilot project that gives local youth a dollar-a-month membership.
And it seems to be already working. Here's his story.

This is a short feature length story I shot in February 2015 for <i>the 25th Hour</i> about a Gatineau bike repair guy who builds his own unicycles and rides them through the park in the wintertime. Produced by Diana Matthews and Emanuela Campanella.

<div class="well">
<b>Intro:</b> Winter cycling through the woods can be tough.
On windy days -- downright wicked.
Jakob Flansberry has found a way to add to that challenge: lose one of your wheels.

 <div class="well">
<b>Intro:</b> In the middle of Ottawa's cold winter, two women are working hard to give their customers a warm taste of Thailand.
Jennie Chanthana and Nina Tawena started their business, the Pinn-to-Thai food truck, so they can share their culture's culinary experience -- and some smiles -- with Canadians.
Their truck is a hit with Ottawans looking for something hot to eat on a cold day.</div>
