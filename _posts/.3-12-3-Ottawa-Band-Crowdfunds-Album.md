#Carleton students prepare for Canadian drone industry to soar into U.S.

OTTAWA -- Canada is far ahead of the U.S. in the potentially lucrative drone industry, with regulators, educators and industry working to give the country a competitive advantage.

Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, gained attention recently when it announced the company is testing unmanned drones for package deliveries to its customers.

But according to a Carleton aerospace engineering professor, Canada is ahead of the U.S. in regulating drones– also known as Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles, or UAVs for short– for commercial use.

That gives the Canadian commercial drone industry an edge.

“What’s interesting is that here in Canada you can do this but in the U.S. you’re not allowed,” Jeremy Laliberte said.

“In the U.S., private companies are not allowed to fly UAVs at the moment.”

That’s because the American Federal Aviation Administration is in the process of designing a “roadmap” for drone regulations, which isn’t expected to finish until 2015 at the earliest.

At the same time south of the border, as many as 28 states are considering anti-drone regulations.

A Transport Canada working group has already figured out how to regulate commercial use of unmanned aircraft in this country.

Laliberte said this means Canadian companies have a “window of opportunity” to get a leg up on the U.S.

“The companies that I deal with are all anticipating this change that’s coming,” he said.

> ##### "They’re setting themselves up to be able to jump into the U.S. and fly these kinds of missions that they’ve been doing here for years already.”

A number of Canadian drone based companies have sprung up in recent years.

A former IT worker has a contract with the city of Ottawa to scare away geese from the Petrie island beech with an unmanned drone.

And Ottawa-based Duwatech uses them to inspect infrastructure and buildings.

Other Canadian companies have been awarded contracts to fly military cargo and inspect crops.

Meanwhile, Carleton students are much closer than Amazon to seeing their drone projects take off with success.

Carleton University’s engineering department started working on unmanned drone projects in 1999, before there was a drone industry in Canada.

What started as a project to give students more hands-on experience has led to a much broader program in unmanned aircraft with government and industry funding for its projects.

“There are companies in Canada — quite a few actually — that are making money and they’re hiring people in this field,” he said. 

> ##### “There are graduates of our program who are already working with companies that do UAV work. The vast majority are working on manned aircraft but more and more of them are working in the UAV field.”

“Companies need engineers who can understand these systems.”

Carleton engineering students have two drone projects on the go: the GeoSurv II and the Corvus uninhabited aerial vehicles.

The GeoSurv is an 8 year partnership project with Sander Geophysics Ltd., one of the largest airborne geophysics companies in the world.

It flies aircraft to collect data on underground geography and can determine if there are minerals, oil or gas deposits in an area. Drones could potentially collect better data by flying lower to the ground.

The GeoSurv is big enough to fill a standard parking space and has a wingspan of 4 metres.

The other plane, the Corvus, has a considerably smaller body with a similar wing span of about 3.7 metres.

Designed and built by students, the Corvus drone flew for the first time this fall.

“It could be used for wildlife surveys, environmental monitoring, geography and remote sensing,” Laliberte said.

Tarek Abdalla is a fourth year engineering student who coordinates the flight tests.

In the large Mackenzie building workshop where the aircraft is stored, it takes him and another student just a few minutes to assemble the Corvus drone.

The wingspan is so large it blocks off the hallway so people have to step over it.

The plan is to outfit the Corvus with Micropilot autopilot technology so the aircraft can “take off, cruise around and land with auto-pilot,” said Abdalla.

“I think it’s very exciting especially because we flew for the first time.”

He said the project takes up from 100 to 150 hours throughout a term for about 26 students.

"It’s a fair amount of work we have to put in to get this thing flying."

While Amazon’s high-flying plans for drone travel grounded for the moment, these students are looking to take their drones to the next level.

“Right now it has a maximum flight time of about 15 minutes but our final goal is to get it to fly for about 4 hours if we change the electric engine to a gasoline engine.”
