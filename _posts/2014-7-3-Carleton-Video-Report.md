This is a feature report I worked on for [Centretown News Online](http://www.centretownnews.ca/multimedia-mainmenu-131/4553-mementoes-of-days-gone-by.html) in March 2014 â€” my first time reporting on camera.

**Announcer Intro** In this ephemeral, wired world, there are still many who prefer to seek out solid mementoes of days gone by. 

Kyle Duggan reports from the Ottawa Nostalgia and Collectibles show.
