#Valentines Day ‘flower boy’ brings cheer to singles with sponsorship, teamwork

This is a fun voicer I did for a radio class newscast at Carleton in 2014.

**Anouncer Intro:** It’s Valentines Day –- a holiday that can often leave singles feeling left out. 

But across the city, about a dozen cyclists are working hard to spread a little _love_ to those who look like they might need it. 

As Kyle Duggan reports, it all started with _one cupid_ who’s not so much a _match-maker_ as he is _cheer-maker_.
