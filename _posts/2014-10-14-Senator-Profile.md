<p>	A Liberal Senator says Justin Trudeau's decision to remove Senators from his party's caucus is a fundamental reform to the upper chamber which has made Senators more independent. </p>

<p>     Grant Mitchell, a Liberal Senator for Alberta, said it's a historic time for the Senate, and welcomed the move, while at the same time lamented getting the cold shoulder from his party's leader.</p>

<p>     In January, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau made his answer to the Senate reform question clear when he pledged to appoint Senators on a non-partisan basis and barred Liberal Senators from the national Liberal caucus. </p>

<p>     “I feel a sadness about that,” Mitchell said.</p>

<p>     “I had good friends there. I just don't see them there anymore.”</p>

<p>     The “fired” Liberal Senators still unofficially caucus together but can no longer do so with the Liberal MPs.</p>

<p>     Senators still hold their Liberal party membership cards and, while they aren't whipped, tend to vote en bloc.</p>

<p>     A former Liberal leader himself at the provincial level in Alberta, Mitchell said he wasn't on board with the idea before it happened, but quickly warmed to it.</p>

<p>     “The institution needed that,” said Mitchell. “It was a cathartic moment.”</p>

<p>     “I was wrong, and [Trudeau] was right, and things have evolved in a very, very strong way.”</p>

<p>     Mitchell said it's opened up a safe distance between the Senate and the Liberal leader, making it easier to say dirty words like “carbon tax” without causing any fallout for Trudeau.</p>

<p>     He also said it means cabinet ministers will have to lobby Senators to convince them to vote on bills, thereby giving them more influence over policy.</p>

<p>     Rand Dyck, a Political Science professor at Carleton University who teaches courses on parliamentary legislatures, said the move does indeed free Senators to exercise “sober second thought,” but that would only be meaningful if a majority of Senators were independent. </p>

<p>     “Only the Liberals are more independent so far, and that doesn't matter at the moment when the Conservative senators are not, but it is a direction I would like to see them all move in,” he said.

<p>     Dyck supports a more independent Senate, but also said that's how the Senate should have always functioned, and sometimes did, so it's not really a “fundamental” reform.</p>

<p>     He also said he can't figure out why the Liberal Party banned them from all party activities, or why the Senators weren't consulted ahead of time about this. </p>

<p>     “At least up to now, Liberal Senators have not been particularly embarrassing, and some of them are quite impressive -- Mitchell being one.</p>

<p>     The Liberals' stance on the Senate came after the second chamber was dragged through the mud in a spending scandal which led to three Conservative Senator's suspensions.</p>

<p>     Mitchell said the upcoming release of the Senate audit, which stems from last year's expense scandal, will be another “awkward period” for their image.</p>

<p>     He said one way they could try to revive the Senate's reputation is by televising all proceedings to show the public more of what they do.</p>

<p>     “It's appalling to me that it isn't televised,” Mitchell said.</p>

<p>     “I think people would be remarkably impressed by some of the debates, if not most of the debates, in that place.” </p>

<p>     But here Dyck disagrees. </p> 

<p>     He said they're right to televise their “impressive” committee work, but the rest of what they do isn't much to write home about -- and won't save their image.     </p>

<p>     “They have rightly chosen not to televise the chamber as a whole, which is not usually that impressive: absenteeism, elderly, and with maybe 25 exceptions, not worth listening to.” </p>
