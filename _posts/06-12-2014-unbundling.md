<p>     If Canada's broadcast and telecommunication regulator orders cable companies to unbundle their TV packages for subscribers, some experts say it could also cause prices to rise for some and reduce channel selection.</p>

  According to a Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission spokesperson, a decision on whether to force broadcasters to offer a pick and pay option is expected to come out sometime in the first few months of 2015, but they don't have a date set yet.

  Unbundling cable packages so consumers can pick and choose the channels they want is a key policy plank for the federal Conservatives and made it into the last Throne Speech – but it's something the three big providers – Bell, Shaw and Rogers -- oppose.

  Rich Leffley, a cook for the Maple Leafs hockey team, is the kind of TV watcher the Conservatives hope this policy attracts.

  "It's definitely something I'm for,” he said.

  Leffley is a huge sports fan, a bit older than the biggest demographic of people opting out of cable, about 18-24 if you look at the latest Nielson figures, and he thinks cable companies are ripping him off with current bundles and pricing plans.

  "It's ridiculous you should have to pay an extra fee, if you're already pay for cable, to pay to watch the Leafs play on a Wednesday night,” he said.

   Leffley watches mostly sports, but also peruses a lot of U.S. programming on the dial, like South Park and late night talk shows.

   He doesn't watch most of the channels he gets.

   “There's a whole bunch of channels you'd get on basic cable from zero to 28 that you'd never even think to stop and watch, like the shopping channel. Or French channels that people are meant to pay for but in reality people never watch.”

   Leffley says a move to pick and pay TV could change his vote – it's not the big ballot box question for him, but he said it would make him look at a party or candidate much more closely.

   And it's something the Conservatives have clearly indicated they want to happen.

   A letter sent by former Heritage Minister James Moore to the CRTC chair on his first day on the job back in 2012, which laid out what the regulator's priorities should be, told him  “consumers should have access to more programming choices and affordable choices across all distribution platforms.”

   Mark Goldberg, a telecommunication consultant, said telling people unbundling could lead to cheaper cable plans and more consumer choice is a politically attractive way for the Conservative government to pander for votes ahead of the 2015 election.

   But he said implementing it would be antithetical to the policy goals because it would increase prices and decrease channel choices.

   “What a lot of folks think unbundling means is not even what's being discussed,” he said.       “You will not have the opportunity to pick only the channels you want. You will still have a basic bundle that includes all sorts of channels that most Canadians don't watch: APTN, the other language service, and Canadians in English Canada will have to have French TV still on their cable bundle.”

   He said this comes at a time when the broadcasting industry is already under “sufficient pressure” from increased competition for eyeballs from online services.

   “I think some broadcasters will go dark and I think that some creators on the production side will not have an opportunity to produce because they won't have stations that are around to buy their programming.”

   That's in step with what the cable companies are arguing.

   The CRTC has been studying what a pick and pay model might do to the industry, something that publicly culminated in a regulatory proceeding this fall called Let's Talk TV, where telecom companies and channels like Disney raised concerns this could threaten their business, while many consumer advocate groups voiced optimism.

   Rogers said in its CRTC submission that "only a small minority of consumers would benefit from such a regime.”

   A consultant report by Oliver Wyman, paid for by Rogers and Shaw, suggests five to 15 per cent of Canadian TV subscribers would save on cable costs, while most others could see a bill increase of up to 12 per cent, and the number of available channels could drop by over half.

   Michael Geist, a communications law professor at the University of Ottawa, said the government sees communications policy -- like unbundling, or when it backtracked on its policy to bill internet subscribers based on how much data they use -- as "pocket book" issues: the sort of thing that can move votes.

   “They've come to recognize that communications is a big part of monthly expenses and want to be seen to be doing something about it,” Geist said.

   He thinks that Goldberg and others are right that it might lead to fewer channels, but Geist doesn't see that as a bad thing.

   “There are many channels that have very limited viewership and it doesn't make much sense to force the public to subsidize those programs by loading them into bundles.”

   As for pricing, he said there's lots of uncertainty there.

   “I think some Canadians will be surprised at the à la carte pricing for some channels. That said, bundles will still be available and many that only want a couple of channels will likely pay less.”

   The Competition Bureau thinks a move on channel unbundling will lead to more competition and higher quality programming – but probably fewer channels.

   Renee Duplantis, a Competition Bureau economist who appeared before the CRTC in the Let's Talk TV hearings, says the economic theory behind shifting to pick and pay is mixed – and Canada would be a world first.

   “No one's done the natural experiment right now to say what would happen,” she said.

   “The FCC [the US communications regulator] did a study many years ago on this, and their first report said prices would go up. The second report said prices would go down. So I think that's quite indicative that no one really knows at this point in time.”

   The closest example, she said, is Quebec, where Quebecor's Videotron already moved to a pick and pay offering.

   Viewers there have some options with basic cable, and after that can purchase additional packages of 10 or 20 more channels that they choose.

   “If you speak to consumers in Quebec they seem to value the flexibility they have in that market,” Duplantis said.

   In provinces like Ontario, though, incumbent companies have been less open to trying “à la carte” pricing.

   CRTC Chairman Jean-Pierre Blais has indicated he's for some sort of pick and pay model, but said there's still many “interrelated issues” to consider before a regulatory decision comes out, although he doesn't seem to buy that the industry is under a lot of pressure.

   CRTC data shows that cable and satellite companies lost 386,000 cable subscribers last year, but as Blais pointed out in a speech in Vancouver last month, if you group cable subscriptions with Internet Protocol TV – in other words, watching cable channels online -- it's only down by about 7,600 subscribers, or a 0.1 per cent loss.

   “The CRTC will not find wise counsel in the rhetoric of today’s pundits and incumbents who have created new technological ‘death stars’ to scare the regulator into action or inaction. Nor should we embrace knee-jerk solutions to complex problems,” Blais said in his speech.

   “We don’t react to every fad or buy into the hype when people claim the sky is falling and that all things good and Canadian will come to an end if we don’t cling to the security of the status quo.”

   Michael Geist said that in the long term, Canadians seem to be moving slowly to online video services like online TV subscription services and what industry insiders call “over the top” services – online streaming or channels that skirt fees and regulations, like Canadian content subsidies, imposed on cable companies -- like YouTube and Netflix.

   But that's still a long way away.

   “Cable won't die quickly and those companies will work to ensure that consumers stay within their systems for as long as possible.”
