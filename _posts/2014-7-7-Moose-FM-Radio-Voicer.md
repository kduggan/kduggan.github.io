When I worked at 94.1 FM in Elliot Lake, I mostly wrote script-clips or aired full interviews. 

But some times I’d get the chance to report live or record a voice report for the afternoon or weekend. 

Here’s one I did in 2009 on a national heritage day that was started because of a dedicated veteran in the city.
